# Biodiesel-Yield-Using-ANN

This is a practice project working with experimental data gotten from a research paper' on Elsevier journal. In this project, I aimed to train a model to predict biodiesel yield given a set of input features; temperature, pressure, reaction time, and methanol/oil (M/O) ratio. I went about this by dividing my dataset (with 42 examples), into a training set, a validation set, and a test set in a ratio of 3:1:1. This project was done using MATLAB R2021a
